---

## PRIORITY 1: IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS

### 1.1 Create Missing Week 6 Exercise Set

**Issue:**
- Opgave 5 exists for Week 5 (procedures, triggers, transactions)
- No `06_opgave.md` exists for Week 6 (security, user management, backup)

**Recommendation:**
- Create `docs/06_opgave.md` with hands-on security exercises
- Should cover:
  1. Create database users with different privilege levels
  2. Grant/revoke privileges
  3. Perform mysqldump backup
  4. Restore from backup
  5. Test user access restrictions

**Suggested Exercises:**
```
6.1 Create a read-only user for the northwind database
6.2 Create an admin user for the employees database
6.3 Grant SELECT on specific tables only
6.4 Backup northwind database structure only
6.5 Backup northwind database data only
6.6 Restore backup with a different database name
6.7 Verify permissions with SHOW GRANTS
```

## PRIORITY 2: ENHANCEMENTS & REFINEMENTS

### 2.1 Add Learning Objectives to Each Week

**Issue:**
- Course materials don't clearly state learning objectives
- Students don't know what they should be able to do after each week

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Learning Objectives" section at the beginning of each `XX_Kursusgang.md`

**Example Format:**
```markdown
# Kursusgang 2: DDL (Data Definition Language)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this week, you should be able to:

1. Create and drop databases
2. Create, modify, and delete tables
3. Understand and apply different data types
4. Define primary keys and constraints
5. Insert, update, and delete data safely
6. Use AUTO_INCREMENT and DEFAULT values
7. Work with NULL constraints
```

---

### 2.2 Add Practice Commands Section to Each Week

**Issue:**
- Students sometimes unsure how to practice independently
- No "Try it Yourself" guidance

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Practice Commands" or "DIY Exercise" section to each course material file
- Short, self-contained exercises students can try during the session

**Example:**
```markdown
## Dine Egne Øvelser (Try It Yourself)

Åbn MySQL Workbench og prøv disse kommandoer:

1. Opret en ny database kaldet `øvelse_2`
2. Opret en tabel for dine venner med feltene: navn, email, telefon
3. Indsæt 3 poster
4. Opdater en email adresse
5. Slet en post
```

---

### 2.3 Improve Installation Guide Consistency

**Files:** `docs/00_install.md`, `README.md`

**Current State:**
- ✓ Custom scripts removed
- ✓ Links to official MySQL guides added
- ✓ Database load commands documented

**Suggestion:**
- Add small note in `00_install.md` about what to do after installation completes
- Add troubleshooting section for common installation issues

**Example Addition:**
```markdown
## Næste Skridt Efter Installation

Når MySQL og Workbench er installeret:

1. Start MySQL Workbench
2. Opret forbindelse til lokal server (127.0.0.1:3306)
3. Åbn `docs/sql/samples/northwind.sql` i Workbench
4. Kør scriptet for at indlæse Northwind database
5. Kør Exercise 1.1 test: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;` (should return 300024)
```

---

### 2.4 Add SQL Best Practices Guide

**Issue:**
- Course covers SQL syntax but not best practices
- Students learn to write queries but not how to write them well

**Recommendation:**
- Create new file: `docs/sql_best_practices.md` covering:
  - Naming conventions (table/column names)
  - Code formatting and readability
  - Performance considerations
  - Security (SQL injection prevention basics)
  - Documentation in procedures

**Topics:**
```markdown
- Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase for keywords (SELECT, FROM)
  - Use snake_case for identifiers
  - Be descriptive with names

- Query Formatting
  - Indentation and line breaks
  - Comment complex logic

- Performance
  - When to use INDEX
  - EXPLAIN for query analysis
  - Avoiding unnecessary JOINs

- Security
  - Parameter binding in procedures
  - Principle of least privilege for users

- Documentation
  - Comment complex procedures
  - Document business logic
```

---

### 2.5 Create Supplementary: Common Errors & Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue:**
- Students encounter common errors with no guidance
- Course materials don't cover error recovery

**Recommendation:**
- Create `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with:
  - Common MySQL errors and solutions
  - Workbench common issues
  - Database connection problems
  - SQL syntax errors by category

**Example Format:**
```markdown
# Troubleshooting Common Database Errors

## Connection Errors

### Error: "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'"
- Check MySQL service is running
- Verify password is correct
- Use default credentials if unsure: root/root

### Error: "Can't connect to MySQL server"
- Ensure MySQL service is running
- Check if port 3306 is in use
- Restart MySQL service

## SQL Errors

### Error: "Table doesn't exist"
- Verify you selected correct database with USE
- Check table name spelling
- Display tables: SHOW TABLES;

### Error: "Column not found"
- List table columns: DESCRIBE table_name;
- Check spelling and case sensitivity
- Use backticks for reserved words
```

---

### 2.6 Add Recommended Study Schedule

**Issue:**
- No guidance on how long each week should take
- Students don't know if they're on pace

**Recommendation:**
- Add to `docs/README.md` or syllabus:

```markdown
## Tidsplan for Gennemgang

Hver kursusgang er designet til ~2-3 timer undervisning + 2-3 timer selvstudium

| Uge | Kursusgang | Øvelser | Estimeret Tid |
|-----|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Installation + SELECT | 10 øvelser | 5 timer |
| 2 | DDL | 13 øvelser | 6 timer |
| 3 | Normalisering + JOINs | 8 øvelser | 6 timer |
| 4 | Aggregation | 6 øvelser | 5 timer |
| 5 | Procedures + Triggers | 5+ øvelser | 6 timer |
| 6 | Sikkerhed | 7 øvelser | 4 timer |
| 7 | Mini Projekt Eksamen | Self-directed | 8+ timer |
```

---

### 2.7 Improve Exercise Solution Documentation

**Files:** `docs/sql/*_opgave_solutions.sql` and `docs/sql/SOLUTIONS_README.md`

**Suggestion:**
- Add brief comments explaining the "why" in complex solutions
- Add timing information (how long each exercise typically takes)

**Example:**
```sql
-- 3.1: Join employees and titles tables
-- TIME: 5-10 minutes
-- CONCEPT: Inner Join - relates two tables using emp_no
-- KEY POINT: Multiple titles possible per employee due to job changes
-- ROW COUNT: 443,308 rows (employees × their title history)

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, t.title
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN titles t ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
ORDER BY t.title;
```

---

### 2.8 Add Visual Summary Cards

**Issue:**
- Complex topics (normalization, joins) hard to grasp at first glance
- Would benefit from visual quick-reference

**Recommendation:**
- Create summary graphics/cheat sheets for:
  1. **SQL Clauses Order**: SELECT → FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → ORDER BY
  2. **JOIN Types**: Visual comparison of INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL
  3. **Normalization**: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF quick rules
  4. **Data Types**: Common types and when to use them

**Could be:**
- PNG reference diagrams in `/docs/images/`
- Markdown-based cheat sheets
- Printable quick-reference guides

---

## PRIORITY 3: MINOR REFINEMENTS

### 3.1 Standardize Course Material Format

**Observation:**
- Some files use "Kursusgang" title format, others don't
- Content depth varies

**Suggestion:**
- Standardize each lesson to include:
  - Learning Objectives (top)
  - Main Content (sections)
  - Key Syntax Examples (highlighted box)
  - Practice Exercises (self-guided)
  - Related SQL Example File (reference)
  - Further Reading (links)

---

### 3.2 Add Estimated Exercise Times

**Issue:**
- Students don't know time commitment per exercise
- Helps time management

**Suggestion:**
```markdown
### 1.1 Basic SELECT Query
**Time Estimate:** 5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Concepts:** SELECT, FROM
**Expected Result:** 300,024 rows
```

---

### 3.3 Create Quick Reference Card PDF

**Issue:**
- Students need quick access to common SQL syntax
- Printing a reference helps studying

**Suggestion:**
- Create printable one-page reference sheet covering:
  - Basic SELECT syntax
  - Common WHERE conditions
  - JOIN syntax comparison
  - GROUP BY + aggregates
  - INDEX creation
  - Stored procedure template

---

### 3.4 Consistency: English vs Danish in Week 6

**Issue:**
- Week 6 (`06_Kursusgang.md`) is written mostly in English
- Rest of course is in Danish

**Recommendation:**
- Translate 06_Kursusgang.md to Danish for consistency
- Or provide Danish/English parallel sections

**Note:** This is less critical since many MySQL terms are used in English internationally, but consistency matters for course cohesion
