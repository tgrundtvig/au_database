# MySQL Security: Common Threats and Best Practices

This document provides a summary of MySQL security best practices based on industry recommendations.

## Common Security Threats

### 1. Mismanagement of Account Access
Assigning excessive privileges to users creates significant security risks. Always give every user the least amount of privileges needed to do their work.

### 2. Weak Passwords
Inadequate password strength enables unauthorized access.

**Recommendations:**
- Use 15+ characters minimum
- Mix uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special symbols
- Avoid dictionary-based passwords
- Avoid personal information (birthdays, names, etc.)

### 3. DDoS Attacks (Distributed Denial of Service)
Attackers overwhelm databases with rapid fake queries.

**Mitigations:**
- Limit maximum connections
- Disable persistent connections when not needed
- Implement rate limiting
- Use connection pooling properly

### 4. SQL Injection Attacks
Attackers inject malicious SQL commands into query strings.

**Prevention:**
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use ORM frameworks with built-in protections
- Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries

### 5. Remote Preauth User Enumeration
Unsanitized inputs allow attackers to validate user existence.

**Prevention:**
- Sanitize all user-generated inputs
- Use consistent error messages
- Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts

### 6. Race Conditions
Simultaneous operations executed out of sequence cause data integrity errors.

**Solutions:**
- Avoid shared states where possible
- Use thread synchronization
- Implement atomic operations
- Use MySQL transactions with proper isolation levels

## 8 Best Practices for MySQL Security

### 1. Remove Default Accounts
- Delete test databases
- Remove anonymous accounts
- Change default port 3306 to a non-standard port
- Remove sample databases and users

### 2. Restrict Remote Access
- Limit connections to necessary applications only
- Use firewalls to restrict database access
- Bind MySQL to specific IP addresses
- Use VPN for remote administration

### 3. Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimal required access per user role
- Separate user accounts by function
- Regularly audit user privileges
- Remove unused accounts promptly

### 4. Use Non-Root Accounts
- Create specific accounts for different purposes
- Never use root account for application connections
- Disable root remote login
- Use role-based access control

### 5. Physical Server Security
- Secure physical access to hardware
- Use locked server rooms
- Implement access logging
- Use encrypted storage

### 6. Implement Auditing & Monitoring
- Track access logs and configuration changes
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Regularly review audit logs
- Use MySQL Enterprise Audit plugin

### 7. Regular Security Assessment
- Continuously evaluate database security posture
- Perform regular vulnerability scans
- Keep MySQL updated with latest security patches
- Review and update security policies

### 8. Strong Authentication & Encryption
- Use robust password policies
- Implement SSL/TLS for connections
- Encrypt data at rest
- Use authentication plugins
- Consider two-factor authentication for critical systems

## Key MySQL Security Commands

```sql
-- View users and their hosts
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

-- Create user with strong authentication
CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';

-- Grant minimal privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';

-- View user privileges
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host';

-- Revoke privileges
REVOKE privilege ON database.table FROM 'username'@'host';

-- Remove user
DROP USER 'username'@'host';
```

## SSL/TLS Configuration

```sql
-- Require SSL for user
ALTER USER 'username'@'host' REQUIRE SSL;

-- Check SSL status
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%ssl%';
```

## Summary

Effective MySQL security combines:
- **Technical controls**: Encryption, access restrictions, input validation
- **Operational practices**: Monitoring, regular assessment, privilege management
- **User awareness**: Strong passwords, security training, incident reporting

Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential.
