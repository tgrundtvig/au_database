## Running the Solutions

To run any solution file:

```bash
mysql -u root < docs/sql/01_opgave_solutions.sql
```

Or open in MySQL Workbench and execute.

## Database Setup

Both sample databases are installed and verified:
- **employees**: 300,024 employee records across 6 tables
- **northwind**: Sample company data with 20 tables

## Changes from Original Exercises

All exercises have been updated to match our actual database schemas:

1. **Northwind column names**: `list_price` (not `UnitPrice`), `category` text (not `CategoryID` integer)
2. **Removed columns**: No `Region`, `UnitsInStock`, `HomePage` in our version
3. **Exercise 4.5 & 4.6**: Thresholds adjusted to match our sample data
4. **Exercise 3.8**: Now correctly shows 0 rows (all departments have employees)

All row counts have been verified and are correct for our databases.

## Notes

- All markdown exercise files (.md) are authoritative and match our schemas exactly
- The PDF files (Opgave_*.pdf) have been preserved as reference material
- Students should follow the markdown exercise files, not the PDFs
